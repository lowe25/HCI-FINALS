			<p>“The growth in technology has helped too. Now artists can stream their music to millions and if they convert just a small percentage into paying fans, they’ve got a credible income. It’s a positive move in many ways. It gets young people off the streets and allows people from lives of hardship to make a change, while inspiring people in the process.”</p>

		<p>There hasn’t been a better time in hip-hop than now for the independent artist to thrive, connect with fans, play live shows, make money and be successful.With the ease of setting up a website, the power of social media and all the free independent hip-hop resources out there, an independent rapper can create, distribute and promote, all from their laptop.</p>

		<center><h1>Why Support Indenpendent Artists?</h1></center>
		<aside class="label">
<p>The labels used to represent opportunity. They were the gatekeepers to either success or obscurity. If you could catch an Artist Representatives ear, and make a good impression the stars could align for you. The downside to this framework, was that they had all the control. There were very few options for success, if you couldn’t catch their eathe it now, with fewer and fewer gatekeepers, the gates are wide open and unguarded.
Now, if an artist works hard enough, is savvy enough, and innovative enough, they can make their own opportunities. Now the challenge is capital and support. In the past, if you could get the labels support, you were very likely to produce quality recordings. Without the support that they used to offer, the burden of the need for quality falls solely on the artist.
It used to be that, if you like a band you went to the store and bought their record. Now there are so many ways to stream music for free, you don’t really HAVE to buy it to listen to it. Here is the crux of the issue. If people don’t buy an artists music, the artist has less money coming in to go towards the next record. And, unless they are independently wealthy, they will have to find a way to monetize their craft to ensure it’s sustainability.
As an artist in this very predicament, I am acutely aware of these circumstances. While I am a musician, I am also a husband to an amazing woman who supports me and my music in every way, and a father of three beautiful children. Together my wife and I decided, years ago, that we were going to lower our standard of living as much as we could, while still responsibly providing for the family. We needed to keep our overhead as low as possible to be able to do whatever was needed to pursue this endeavor. It’s a hard thing when your artistic craft needs to make money, but that is what will make it a career viability.
When I find an artist or band that I like, I try to buy something at their show or purchase their music from a site that will give them the largest cut of the proceeds (like directly from their website). I sign up for mailing lists, “like” pages on Facebook, follow them on Twitter; that way I can be aware of what support they need and how I can help. I am not always able to provide that help, but at least I can spread the word. I figure when I bought records at the store back in the day, I was paying someone I had never met and maybe not even seen, but now I can support someone local or independent. In other words, someone who needs it the most.</p>
